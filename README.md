## REASONABLE LIMITATION:
* Projects that have 3-7 database tables. ~3-5 preferably.

## Azure SQL Database use is mandatory in projects.
Note: you may use database-first approach which many teams find easier.

## Technologies you MUST use (unless creating a game with a separate game engine):
* WPF, C#
* SQL Database via Azure
* Entity Framework via LINQ
* Multiple windows, dialogs (at least 3~5 windows total)

## Other:
* At least 10 unit tests, using VisulStudio unit testing or NUnit, similar to
https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/test/developer-testing/getting-started/getting-started-with-developer-testing
* at least 1-2 additional libraries should be used, ideally (not counting EF)
* Material Design Toolkit use is encouraged

## Possible technologies (in no special order, pick at least 3):
* UserControl (also helps minimize conflicts)
* Drag and drop
* Ribbon instead menus
* StackPanel, GridSplitter (highly recommended)
* TabControl, ToolBar, TreeView
* Extended WPF Toolkit controls https://github.com/xceedsoftware/wpftoolkit
* Wizards (step-by-step)
* Sound, Animation, Video playback using Media Player control, Camera access (for photo or video)
* PDF-generation, export to Excel
* Printing using WPF or additional library
* Drawing on canvas (e.g. Charts with data) via custom libraries
* WebAPIs client (e.g. stocks, weather)
* Installer (recommended as the finishing touch)
* Localization (translation into multiple languages)
* Storing binary data (pictures, etc.) in a BLOB
